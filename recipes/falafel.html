    <ul>
        <li>1 kg dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>generous portion chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 head roast garlic (or 1/2 head raw)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne</li>

        <li>vegetable oil</li>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>One day ahead:</strong> Pour the chickpeas into a
            large bowl and cover them by about 3 inches of cold water.
            Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the water and stir; this will
            help soften the chickpeas. Cover the bowl and let them soak
            overnight in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator. The
            chickpeas should soak at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours,
            until tender (change soaking water for fresh water after 12
            hours). They will double in size as they soak – you will have
            between 4 and 5 cups of beans after soaking.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the chickpeas well. Pour them into your food
            processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley,
            flour or chickpea flour (use chickpea flour to make gluten
            free), salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne
            pepper, and cardamom. <strong>Note:</strong> if you have a smaller food
            processor, you will want to divide the ingredients in half
            and process the mixture one batch at a time.</li>
        <li>Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal
            forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and
            push the mixture down the sides. Process until the mixture
            is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste.
            You want the mixture to hold together, and a more paste-like
            consistency will help with that... but don't over-process,
            you don't want it turning into hummus!</li>
        <li>Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out
            into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture
            more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that
            the processor missed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
            refrigerate for 1-2 hours.
            Fill a skillet with vegetable oil to a depth of 1 ½ inches.
            I prefer to use cooking oil with a high smoke point, like
            grapeseed. Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. The ideal
            temperature to fry falafel is between 360 and 375 degrees F;
            the best way to monitor the temperature is to use a deep fry
            or candy thermometer. After making these a few times, you
            will start to get a feel for when the oil temperature is
            "right." Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or
            slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop.
            I usually use about 2 tbsp of mixture per falafel. You can
            make them smaller or larger depending on your personal
            preference. The balls will stick together loosely at first,
            but will bind nicely once they begin to fry. </li>
    </ol>
